                <p>The scissors hit the paper by cutting it apart, but breaks if it tries to cut into the rock. The paper hit the rock by enclosing it. 
                    In this way, each symbol hits a certain other symbol, draws a draw against its copy and is scored by the third.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this game you compete against the computer and to make your move, choose one of the icon - rock, paper or scissor. 
                    Immediately after you've done your move, you get the result, and it will be showed in two ways. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1. A colored border will appear around the icon. Red means you lose, green that you won, and gray if it's a draw. <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Above the icons, you will also receive a message telling you the result.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Below the icons you will also find a result board where you can follow the match.
                    <br>
